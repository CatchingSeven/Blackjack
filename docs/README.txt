This is a small project I'm working on during my uni break.
The primary purpose is to refresh my C++ knowledge but also to further solidfy it.
My plan is to create the blackjack game as a console game first, then turn it into an actual interactive game using SFML after the core logic is complete

Current Objectives:
1. Dynamic window scale & dynamic card scaling and placement
2. Menu screen
3. game looping, game shouldnt just end after one round
4. Pausing
5. backgrounds, and other graphics
6. animations
7. betting?
8. score saving, i.e. we want to save a players score, maybe the money they have in game etc
9. settings?
10. Full blackjack experience, right now only hitting and standing, maybe implement double down, splitting etc.
11. Refactoring, Refactoring, Refactoring! the code is very messy especially on the front end, this needs to be fixed.
